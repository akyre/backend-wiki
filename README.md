## How to contribute

Contributions will be needed to fill the wiki **correctly and rapidly**.
If you follow those simples guidelines you will make a **coherent and proper** documentation.

*That's our goal*.

Use **simple** English, fancy English only brings confusion and make people struggle for nothing.

Be **clear**, explain your idea with simplicity and structure.

Be **concise**, explain one thing per sentence.
